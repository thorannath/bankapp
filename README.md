Model Responsibilities
The Model in an MVC application represents the state of the application and any business logic or operations that should be performed by it. . 

View Responsibilities
Views are responsible for presenting content through the user interface.

Controller Responsibilities
Controllers are the components that handle user interaction, work with the model, and ultimately select a view to render. In an MVC application, the view only displays information; the controller handles and responds to user input and interaction.
